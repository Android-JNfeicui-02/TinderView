TinderView
========

Created A Simple and Beautiful Tinder like card deck & Captain Train like toolbar.

This is heavily based on [AndroidSwipeableCardStack](https://github.com/wenchaojiang/AndroidSwipeableCardStack), wenchaojiang has written the library very well but i faced a lot of difficulty integrating it & that's the reason i built this app so that you dont waste time. Use this repo as a base for your app & build on top :).

API 19 and UP.
